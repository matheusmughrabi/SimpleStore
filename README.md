# SimpleStore

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

SimpleStore is a project which I created to practice design patterns and buildin loosely coupled systems. It contains some basic Register/Login functionality which I implemented mostly from scratch (except for the password hasher), although in the future I intend to use some third-party library to make it more secure. Once the user is registered, he can login to his account, deposit cash to it (and make withdrawals) so that he can purchase products from the store.

I chose to build just a ConsoleUI so that I could focuse a bit more in the Domain and Data Access Layer first, also this will serve me as test to see if these layers were implemented in a nicely decoupled way. In the ConsoleUI project I tried to implement a small framework to add menus in a reusable centralized way, which really helped the productivity of the project.
